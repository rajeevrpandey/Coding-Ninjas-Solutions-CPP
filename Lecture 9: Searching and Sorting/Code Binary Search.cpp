/*
You have been given a sorted(in ascending order) integer array/list(ARR) of size N and an element X. Write a function to search this element in the given input array/list using 'Binary Search'. Return the index of the element in the input array/list. If the element is not present in the array/list, then return -1.
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 'N', which denotes the size of the array/list.

The second line contains 'N' single space-separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.

The third line contains the value of X to be searched for in the array/list.
Output Format :
Print the index at which X is present for each test case, -1 otherwise.
Constraints :
0 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= X <= 10^9
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
7
1 3 7 9 11 12 45
3
Sample Output 1:
1
Sample Input 2:
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
9
Sample Output 2:
-1
